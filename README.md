📞 Telco Customer Churn Prediction:
 An end-to-end Machine Learning project that predicts whether a telecom customer is likely to churn based on service usage, billing information, and customer demographics.
 The project includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and deployment via an interactive Streamlit web application.
 
🚀 Project Overview:
Customer churn is a major challenge in telecom businesses. Losing customers directly impacts revenue.
This project builds a predictive ML system that helps companies:
Identify customers at high churn risk
Take proactive retention actions
Improve customer lifetime value

🧠 Problem Statement:
Predict whether a customer will leave the telecom service using customer information such as:
Account details
Subscription services
Billing data
Customer demographics

Output:
Probability customer will churn
Probability customer will stay
